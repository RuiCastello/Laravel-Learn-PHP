# Laravel-Learn-PHP
Used Laravel to refresh on some PHP functions and play around a bit with laravel, leaving some helpful comments.

[DEMO](https://demos.canalfoto.org/learn-php/strings) 
<br />

All interesting code is in the controllers.
<br />
<br />
Routes (GET only):
- /strings
- /numbers
- /forms 
- / 
<br />
